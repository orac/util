# Shadowburst Java utilities

`com.shadowburst.util` is a package for things so useful you don't know why they're not in `java.util`. Currently that's only one class: `WeakList`.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/orac/util.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/orac/util)

## WeakList

`com.shadowburst.util.WeakList` is an implementation of the `java.util.List` interface that uses `WeakReference`s to avoid keeping its elements alive when they would otherwise be garbage-collected. Obviously this means that list indices are unstable, so you can't quite use it like a `List`, but it's much simpler than `java.util.WeakHashMap` for something like a list of callbacks.

## Build and install
`com.shadowburst.util` uses [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) to compile and produce a JAR. Other than for its tests, it has no dependencies. If you're already using Maven, download the source and compile with

    mvn install

and then you can add this dependency to your POM:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.shadowburst</groupId>
    <artifactId>shadowburst-util</artifactId>
    <version>1</version>
</dependency>
```
