## Shadowburst Java utilities

`com.shadowburst.util` is a package for things so useful you don't know why they're not in `java.util`. Currently that's only one class: `WeakList`.

## WeakList

`com.shadowburst.util.WeakList` is an implementation of the `java.util.List` interface that uses `WeakReference`s to avoid keeping its elements alive when they would otherwise be garbage-collected. Obviously this means that list indices are unstable, so you can't quite use it like a `List`, but it's much simpler than `java.util.WeakHashMap` for something like a list of callbacks.

## Software that uses this library
At present, two Shadowburst apps use this library:
* [The Hat Game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shadowburst.hatgame)
* [Showr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shadowburst.showr)

To see your project featured on this list, fork this repo, add your app to the list, and send a pull request.
